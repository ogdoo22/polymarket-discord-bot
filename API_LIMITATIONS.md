Polymarket API Limitations
Overview
This bot uses the Polymarket Gamma API (https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets), which is a public, read-only API that does not require authentication.

Important Limitations
1. Market Coverage (~500 Markets)
The API only returns approximately the top 500 markets by trading volume.

This means:

‚úÖ WILL be found:

High-volume markets (Bitcoin, Trump, major elections)
Popular topics (Fed rates, recession, major geopolitical events)
Trending markets with active trading
‚ùå MAY NOT be found:

Low-volume or niche markets
Newly created markets with little trading activity
Markets that are popular on the website but have low volume
Historical or archived markets
2. Real-World Example
Market visible on website but NOT in API:

"When will the government shutdown end?" ‚ùå
Exists on polymarket.com
NOT returned by API (likely due to low volume)
Markets that ARE in the API:

"Will Trump end Department of Education in 2025?" ‚úÖ
"Fed rate hike in 2025?" ‚úÖ
"US recession in 2025?" ‚úÖ
"Bitcoin hitting $100k in 2025?" ‚úÖ
3. Why This Happens
Polymarket's API appears to prioritize markets by:

Trading volume
Liquidity
Recent activity
Featured/promoted status
The API likely uses a ranking algorithm that excludes lower-priority markets to keep response sizes manageable.

4. API Response Limits
With closed=false: Up to 500 active markets
With closed=true: Up to 500 closed markets
With limit=1000: Still capped at 500 markets
No pagination: Cannot fetch beyond the 500 limit
User Communication Strategy
When Users Can't Find a Market
The bot now includes helpful messaging when no matches are found:

‚ùå No Markets Found

No active markets found matching 'your query'

üí° Suggestions
- Try different or broader keywords
- Check for typos in your search
- Use simpler search terms
- Search for major topics (politics, crypto, economy)

‚úÖ DO search for:

Alternative Solutions (Future)
If the API limitation becomes a major issue, consider:

Web Scraping (not recommended - violates ToS)
Could scrape polymarket.com directly
High maintenance, fragile, against terms of service
CLOB API (more technical)
Polymarket has a CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) API
Requires more complex integration
May have better coverage
User Feedback Loop
Log searches that return no results
Manually check if those markets exist
Update documentation with common missing markets
Hybrid Approach
Use API for main searches
Fallback to direct URL construction for known markets
Example: If "shutdown" search fails, suggest direct link
Testing with Real Markets
Use show_available_markets.py to see what's currently searchable:

bash
python show_available_markets.py
This displays:

Markets by category (Politics, Crypto, Economy, etc.)
Top 20 most popular markets
Keyword search results
Suggested test queries
Monitoring & Analytics
Consider tracking:

Most common search queries
Queries that return no results
Market categories with most searches
User satisfaction/complaints
This data helps identify if API limitations are a real problem vs. user expectations.

Conclusion
This is not a bug - it's an API limitation. The bot is working as designed within the constraints of the public Polymarket API. By setting proper user expectations and providing helpful messaging, the bot can still provide significant value for searching popular markets.

For most use cases (crypto, politics, major events), the bot will work perfectly. Users searching for obscure markets should be directed to polymarket.com directly.
